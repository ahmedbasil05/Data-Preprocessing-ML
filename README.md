# 🧹 Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning

This repository demonstrates **end-to-end data preprocessing techniques** for both **numerical** and **textual** datasets before training machine learning models.  

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Data collection and loading  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & visualization  
✅ Handling missing values (`dropna`, `fillna`, imputation)  
✅ Feature scaling and standardization (`StandardScaler`)  
✅ Train-Test split (`train_test_split`)  
✅ Handling imbalanced data (under-sampling, over-sampling, SMOTE)  
✅ Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)  
✅ Feature extraction with **TF-IDF Vectorizer**  
✅ Separate workflows for **numerical** and **textual** datasets

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **NLTK / spaCy**

## 📊 Example Workflows

Numerical Preprocessing:
Load dataset → Handle missing values → Standardize features → Handle imbalance → Train-test split.
Textual Preprocessing:
Clean text → Tokenize → Remove stopwords → Apply stemming → TF-IDF Vectorization.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed as a reference project for learners and practitioners to:
Understand how raw data is transformed into machine-readable format.
Practice preprocessing for both tabular and textual data.
Build a strong foundation before moving into machine learning models.
